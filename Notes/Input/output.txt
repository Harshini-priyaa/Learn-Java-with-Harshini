As we have already discussed to print a line in JAVA we use "System.out.println()" method.
But to take an input?
   To take input in Java we use a "Scanner" Class 
   We have a syntax to instantiate a object in java => "Method obj_name = new method();"
   Similarly to instantiate a scanner object => "Scanner read = new Scanner(System.in);"
   Here the "System.in" is specified hence the line object is capable of reading an input.

This Scanner class is the easiest way to take an input!!

This scanner object read can be used with any method to read any kind of variable

For integer => nextInt(); [eg: int num  = read.nextInt()]

The readed integer or a variable can be used for performing multiple operations
