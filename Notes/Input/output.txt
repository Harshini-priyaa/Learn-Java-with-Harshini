As we have already discussed to print a line in JAVA we use "System.out.println()" method.
But to take a input?
   To take an input in java we do use a "Scanner" Class 
   We have a syntax to instanciate a object in java => "Method obj_name = new method();"
   Similarly to instanciate a scanner object => "Scanner read = new Scanner(System.in);"
   Here the "System.in" is specified hence the line object is capable of reading an input.

This Scanner class is the most easiest way to take an input!!

This scanner object read can be used with any method to read any kind of variable

For integer => nextInt(); [eg: int num  = read.nextInt()]

The readed integer or a variable can be used for performing multiple operations
