So far on learning something on the basic of Java lets get into an important concept called "VARIABLES"
Variables are just a container to store out things in programming !
Imagine you have 10 chocolates and you want to store them in a fridge and your mom gives you a box to put them on
The box your mom gave is the storage space to store the chocolates you have.
It is same concept applied in programming to store values!
Contrasting this example with the concept of variables:
   BOX your Mom gave => Variable 
   chocolates you have => value
It is something like "chocolate_box = 10"
There are  something called "DATA TYPES" to declare these variables
So each and every variabes based on its preferance has seperate data TYPES
Some of the data types that are supported by Java are:
    1. Integer
    2. Long
    3. Float
    4. Double
    5. Character
    6. Boolean
    7. String
