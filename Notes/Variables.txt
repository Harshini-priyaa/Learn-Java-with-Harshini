So far on learning something about the basics of Java let's get into an important concept called "VARIABLES"
Variables are just containers to store things in programming!
Imagine you have 10 chocolates and you want to store them in a fridge your mom gives you a box to put the chocolates 
The box your mom gave you is the storage space to store the chocolates you have.
It is the same concept applied in programming to store values!
Contrasting this example with the concept of variables:
   BOX your Mom gave => Variable 
   chocolates you have => value
It is something like "chocolate_box = 10"
There is  something called "DATA TYPES" to declare these variables
So each variable based on its preference has separate data TYPES
Some of the data types that Java supports are:   
       TYPE           KEYWORD
    1. Integer        int
    2. Long           long
    3. Float          float
    4. Double         double
    5. Character      char
    6. Boolean        boolean
    7. String         String
Declaration of a variable looks like => int num = 10;
Java has an inbuilt datatype to store string values
Declaration of a string looks like => string fruit = "apple";
