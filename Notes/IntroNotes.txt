Java was first found by the "SUN MICROSYSTEMS" in the year 1991
Now Java is owned by the "ORACLE" 
It is one of the highly secure language available
Java can also be used in the development of embedded systems as the versions of java above 8 has more inbuilt libraries
Java is a robust and platform independent language that can work with any OS like Windows,MAC,Linux
Java is the most used for the backend side in web development as well as it is used in the development of most of the applications
As the Java only needs the JVM(Java Virtual Machine) to run its code
The Java compiler will run the java code in JVM
A Java file has a naming convention that the file should be saved with the name of class written in the file
A Java file holds the extension ".java"
To compile a java code the command to be used is -> "javac filename.java"
And if the code gets compiled without any error then you can compile with the command -> "java filename"
Comments will not show up in the printing screen they are just written for the human understanding
In java commenting can be used -> single line comment => //
                               -> multiline comment => /* */
                               -> for javadoc(used while creating documentation for API's) => /** */
Javadoc comments are used before declaration of fields, methods and classes
