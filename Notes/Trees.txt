Trees are the non-linear data structur.
It has nodes and edges.
The starting point is termed as root

Tree Traversal refers to the process of visiting or accessing each node of the tree exactly once in a certain order. Tree traversal algorithms help us to visit and process all the nodes of the tree. Since tree is not a linear data structure, there are multiple nodes which we can visit after visiting a certain node. There are multiple tree traversal techniques which decide the order in which the nodes of the tree are to be visited.

A tree can be traversed in 3 ways:
  1. Pre-order traversal
  2. In- order Traversal
  3. Post-order traversal
