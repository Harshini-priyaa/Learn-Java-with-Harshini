Compilers catch mistakes in our code and transforms the code to an executable manner
The compilation process in java takes place in a different manner
As we have already discussed the compilation of java takes place in 2 steps 
first -> to compile => javac filename.java
then -> to run the code => java filename

This accounts to the meaning that the file written in the .java extension is transformed to byte code then in runs in the JVM
A sucessful compilation will produce a .class file!
An unsuccessful file produces error

Here for an example :
  we have  a .java file called helloworld.java 
  which when compiled gives another file called helloworld.class -> succesful compilation
  If there occures any mistake then the file will show some error

In java each class is a real world task that has real world entities called objects
