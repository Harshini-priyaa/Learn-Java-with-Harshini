Compilers catch mistakes in our code and transform the code into an executable manner
The compilation process in Java takes place in a different manner
As we have already discussed the compilation of Java takes place in 2 steps 
first -> to compile => javac filename.java
then -> to run the code => java filename

This accounts for the meaning that the file written in the .java extension is transformed to byte code and then in runs in the JVM
A successful compilation will produce a .class file!
An unsuccessful file produces an error

Here is an example :
  we have  a .java file called helloworld.java 
  which when compiled gives another file called helloworld.class -> successful compilation
  If any mistake occurs then the file will show some error

In java each class is a real world task
