The compilation process in java takes place in a diffrent manner
As we have already discussed the compilation of java takes place in 2 steps 
first -> to compile => javac filename.java
then -> to run the code => java filename

This accounts to the meaning that the file written in .java extension is transformed to byte code then in runs in the JVM
A sucessful compilation will produce a .class file!
