/*
  In java everything is made up of classes, there dont even exist a single entity , code is in the class
  There is a rule that the file in java should be saved same as that of the class name
  Here in this I have created a class named "example_classes" where this class will perform functions that we have learnt previously
 */

public class example_classes {
    public static void main(String [] args){
        System.out.println("This code demonstrates a class that is written to add numbers");
        System.out.println(12 + 9);
        
        //This code below also does the same thing as the first one does but in the same line
        System.out.println("The sum of 51 and 22 is: " +(51 + 22));
        

    }
}
