/*
  This is a the first program in any programming language so as in Java
   
  In java things are all defined within class  and so here to print "Hello World" the helloworld class is defined
  The main function is declared so the things to get started
  And to print the "Hello World!" the print statement used is the "System.out.println"
  Where System -> Standard class of Java
        out -> object to display output
        println -> method to print the statement
